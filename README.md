# tango_with_django_project
Welcome to my workspace!
I first pushed many exercises of chapters from 3 to 10 .I know some tests of chapters are failed but i fixed them at the end.
And I think these exercises cut into chapters may be helpful for me to revise.Of course I delete them for you to review and now there is only one folder which is my rango.
Again,thanks for your help during the class.
